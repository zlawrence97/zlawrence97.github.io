                <p> Choosing two images that were already mostly aligned took
		    about an hour and I also tried to make sure the resolutions
		    were about the same as well. To apply the Gaussian filter to
		    the first image I used fspecial() because the structure of
		    the method allows for a cut-off frequency, plus when I tried
		    to implement a previous blurring technique it did not work.
		    I calculated the high frequency image by taking 1-Gaussian
		    of the image instead of performing separate calculations.
		    The original align_images code confused me because its 
		    output is two separate images so every time I thought my 
		    code was not working properly. After almost two hours (way 
		    too long) of researching different alignment methods I got 
		    my code to work with the original to produce the grayscale
		    hybrid image.<br>
		    However, the high frequency images came out white instead
		    of being a smooth gray image so I had to fix that result.
		    I started by attempting to run a filter over the image 
		    instead of simply subtracting the Gaussian ----
		    Next was to convert the greyscale to color to see if the 
		    result was actually good quality. There is not immediate 
		    method to go from grayscale to color ------
		    <br>Note: I combined the pyramids() and hybridImage() 
		    functions to compute the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids as
		     well as align the images. --FINISH DESCRIPTION--
