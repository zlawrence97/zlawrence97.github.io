              <p> Used the skeleton Matlab code to split the given image into thirds and then found the correlation of G and R slices; the offsets are accounted for since the function normxcorr2() has padding. G is then created again to decrease the padding, this is done twice. This same process is repeated for the R and B slices. Then set the values of the new slices to one image, crop the edges and show the image.  
G and B are recreated twice since R is the last piece that is sliced and seems to have the least amount of probability to be too wide.

I chose this method for the simple strategy because it seems to be the most straight forward way to approach the problem. Finding where the three separate splices are most correlated gives a better probability of producing an accurate image. The cropping also helps with the problem of having obviously oustanding edges.

             <p>The algorithm divides the original image into thirds and then blurs each slice, after which each slice is resize by a factor of .5 - shrinking each image. The program is then supposed to run a multi-dimensional alignment on the three images; <b>however I could not figure out how to do this</b>. The offsets calculated are doubled to account for the original image sizes. The program then runs the same alignment algorithm for the three slices and outputs the result. <b>Also could not figure out how to resize for 'newColorImage()' once resized'.</b>
